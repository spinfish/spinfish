i've been working with python for about a year now and so far i absolutely love it, but i don't think i am very good at it. 
i've written a discord bot in the language with the aid of discord.py, although its commands are mostly useless; i consider it a finished project.
also, i am absolutely hopeless at dealing with documents and the command line. it's a miracle that i even managed to set up my bot's vps :')
i may consider learning js or c#, next year for digital technology i will have to do js anyway. we'll see!
