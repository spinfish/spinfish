# Hi! I'm Mackenzie, aka spinfish.

![][views] ![][pronouns] ![][discord]

Recently I've been making a lot of themes for Discord (my communication app of choice), so I guess you could say CSS is my main focus right now, with [Sass][ily sass] being an amazing helper for preventing the code from resembling spaghetti and making the themes' structures modular and nicer to read (I could go on about my appreciation for the godsend that is Sass... but I'll spare you!). You can view them [here][kaleidoscope], [here][Midnight Candy], and [here][midnightcord]!

I started learning Python close to two years ago and consider myself relatively capable in the language. I wrote a Discord bot in it with the aid of [discord.py][dpy], which was fun! I've sort of lost a lot of interest in the language overall now that I've discovered the fascinating realm of CSS, but it continues to be my programming language of choice and I don't think I've fallen out of love with it just yet :p

Recently I have also been (sorta semi kinda) embarking on expanding my JavaScript knowledge. While a lot of the aspects of the language are highly inconsistent and it is rather pale in comparison to Python in terms of customization and overall nice-to-use-ness, it's probably worth having a go at it as things like React are growing quickly ~~and webdev makes a fuckton of money~~. A while back I made a Powercord plugin with it which you can view [here][yawn] (be warned; it's not very useful and the code is rather bland!).

Hope you have a fantastic rest of your day :)
