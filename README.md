i've been working with python for over a year now and i really enjoy it, but i don't think i am very good at it. 
i've written a (not very good) discord bot in the language with the aid of discord.py, and consider this a finished project.
also, i am absolutely hopeless at dealing with documents and the command line. it's a miracle that i even managed to set up my bot's vps :')

i'm definitely considering learning js, partly because in digital technology next year i will have to do it, and partly because i've heard
it's not too different from python and i feel like learning another programming language would be good. we'll see!
