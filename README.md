i've been working with python for about a year and a half now and i *really* enjoy it, but i don't think i am very good at it. 
i've written a discord bot in the language with the aid of [discord.py](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py 'amazing lib that u should go check out'), which has been fun.
also, i am absolutely hopeless at dealing with documents and the command line. it's a miracle that i even managed to set up my bot's vps :^)

i'm definitely considering learning javascript, partly because later this year i'll have to do it for digital technology, and partly because i've
heard it's not too different from python and i feel like learning another programming language would be good. we'll see!
