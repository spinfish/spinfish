i'm coding a discord bot in python. i've been coding with the language for about 10 months now and so far i absolutely love it, but i don't think i am very good at it. 
also, i am absolutely hopeless at dealing with documents and the command line. it's a miracle that i even managed to set up my bot's vps :')
