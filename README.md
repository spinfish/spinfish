# hi! i'm mackenzie. ![][views] ![][pronouns] ![][discord]

recently i've been making a lot of themes for Discord (my communication app of choice) which you can view [here][kaleidoscope], [here][midnight candy] and [here][midnightcord]. CSS sure can get complicated quickly, but i'm entranced by its power nonetheless. also, [sass][ily sass] is a godsend.

i started learning python close to two years ago and consider myself relatively capable in the language, and i *really* like it. i wrote a discord bot in it with the aid of [discord.py][dpy], which was funâ€” sadly however, i'm not as passionate about working on the project as i used to be.

i know a little bit of javascript and [wrote a powercord plugin in it][yawn], and i plan to expand on that knowledge, both for my personal ~~satisfaction~~ journey and for digital technology at school.
