# Hi! I'm Mackenzie, aka spinfish.

![][views] ![][pronouns] ![][discord]

I started learning Python close to two years ago and consider myself relatively capable in the language. I wrote a Discord bot in it with the aid of [discord.py][dpy], which was fun, but is sadly a dying project as I've sort of lost a lot of interest in the language overall now. However, it continues to be my programming language of choice and I don't think I've fallen out of love with it just yet! :p

My most recent projects have been themes for Discord (my communication app of choice), so I guess you could say CSS is my main focus right now, with [Sass][ily sass] being my preprocessor of choice. You can view them [here][amethyst], [here][kaleidoscope], [here][Midnight Candy], and [here][midnightcord]!

Recently I have also been (sorta semi kinda) embarking on expanding my JavaScript knowledge. While a lot of the aspects of the language are highly inconsistent and it is rather pale in comparison to Python in terms of customization and overall usability, it's probably worth having a go at it as things like React are growing quickly ~~and webdev makes a fuckton of money~~. A while back I made a Powercord plugin with it which you can view [here][yawn] (be warned; it's not very useful and the code is rather bland!). I'm also slightly interested in C++ and Rust.

Hope you have a fantastic rest of your day :)
